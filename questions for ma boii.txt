When spacing a non-text element on HTML, is it better to use <p> or <div> or both. I noticed that <div> doesn't space very well.
Separating attributes. Seems to work with/without comma, what is your preference?
What is markup?
Double quotes/single quotes compatability-wise with CSS and JS?
<!DOCTYPE html>. My code seems to run without this?
Meta charset in head?
Link javascript in footer or end of body?
How to know when something is an empty element or not, other than documentation?



// some random css that loads by default
.thiscss {thingsss}

.morecss {sdfgsdgsdg}

.div{background-image:image-url};
